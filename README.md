# Pinball Machine Quadrant Model - PCC3100 Engineering Design Representation
This project was completed as part of the PCC3100 Engineering Design Representation course. The objective was to design a digital model of a pinball machine using Siemens NX software. The pinball machine was divided into four quadrants, each assigned to a different group member.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project was to design a virtual model of a pinball machine. The machine was divided into four quadrants, with each team member responsible for designing and implementing three obstacles in their assigned quadrant. The challenge was to create a path for the ball to follow from a fixed start point to a fixed finish point, ensuring that the obstacles in each quadrant contributed to the overall flow.

# Design Process
Quadrant Layout: The baseboard of the machine was divided into four sections. Each student was responsible for their quadrant, designing obstacles and paths using Siemens NX.

Obstacle Design: Each quadrant featured three unique obstacles (e.g., ramps, bumpers, and tunnels), designed to interact with the ball's movement and guide it toward the finish.

Baseboard Cutting: Students had to virtually cut the baseboard and position the obstacles in Siemens NX to create a seamless path for the ball. It was essential to ensure that the ball moved smoothly through the quadrants without interruption.

# Software
Siemens NX: This project was completed entirely using Siemens NX, a powerful engineering design software that allowed for the creation of detailed 3D models and simulations of the pinball machine. The software was crucial for designing the obstacles, cutting the baseboard, and simulating the movement of the ball through the machine.
Challenges and Learning Outcomes
Collaborative Design Integration: Designing each quadrant to fit with the neighboring sections required careful coordination and collaboration between team members.

Software Mastery: Mastering Siemens NX to create precise digital models was a significant part of the learning experience. Students had to learn advanced features such as part modeling, assembly, and simulation.

Problem Solving in Virtual Space: Without physical materials, students had to rely entirely on digital tools to troubleshoot design issues, making the project a valuable exercise in digital engineering and design thinking.

# Conclusion
The Pinball Machine Quadrant Model project provided a comprehensive learning experience in digital design representation using Siemens NX. It required teamwork, problem-solving, and the application of engineering principles to create a functional virtual model of a pinball machine. This project demonstrated the importance of digital tools in modern engineering and fostered an understanding of the integration of design and simulation.
